portfolio: Simple portfolio optimization for the risk averse.
=============================================================

Investing is hard, not because there isn't enough information, but because there isn't enough time.
This is a collection of simple tools, that I've found helpfull in composing my personal portfolio,
with emphasis on index-funds over single stocks, with a breadth over depth mentality.
Being employed in the technology space (internet advertising in particular), I'm incredibly sensitive to over-investimg myself in comparable businesses. The risk profiles of my portfolio and employment should be complementary, with minimal overlap.

In no particular order, these are some things that I look for when designing a portfolio:

1. Not cherry picking AAPL, FB, GOOG, TWTR, or related technology stocks (especially advertising based). Seeing as how I'm employed by this industry, doubling investing myself seems overly bold considering the concentration risk.
2. Not investing solely in SPY. I love the S&P 500, I really do, but there is more to the global economy. Do I include a little SPY (or similar)? Absolutely, but it isn't the be all and end all of the market.
3. Minor volatility hedging. VXX is great for this, and gives a little more peace of mind when money is on the line.
4. Not cherry picking AAPL, FB, GOOG, TWTR etc. Seriously internet, we've been over this.
5. Exposure to Natural Resources, the TSX composite is a good fit for this, if you can also stomach investing in life-insurance or related finance at the same time.
6. Energy: it's a thing, and we all love it. Also despite how we all love to hate "Oil and Gas" (the biggest players in the space), they tend to have very high dividend yield.
7. Dividend yield: because your savings account does nothing except make your cash illiquid.
8. REITs: Many are gun-shy after 2008, but real-estate continues to climb (or deliver high dividend yield). In my mind, investing in REITs are a strong alternative that under a reasonable risk ceiling are safer bets than actually purchasing property.
9. Even balance between Telecom/Semiconductor and Biotech/Pharmaceuticals. Can't stomach buying any more of Alcatel Lucent? Then stop buying Sanofi.
10. Heavy industry; because it isn't going anywhere.
